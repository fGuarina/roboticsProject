'''
	The following program will control the servo making it move 
	to its neutral position (for us 0 degrees), 
	wait 1 second and then move to its 110 degrees, 
	The cycle continues until interrupted
	
	dc = leght / period, so
	for 0.5 impulse we have dc = (0.5 / 20) * 100 = 2.5 clockwise rotation
	for 1.5 impulse we have dc = (1.5 / 20) * 100 = 7.5 (90째 position)
	for 2.5 impulse we have dc = (2.5 / 20) * 100 = 12.5 
	
	So, the neutral position is 0째 -> p.start(2)
	and clockwise rotation to 0째 ->  p.ChangeDutyCycle(3.5)  
	
	NOTE: 
	If the servo motor shakes a bit while it is not moving, 
	you can pause the pulse with ChangeDutyCycle(0)
